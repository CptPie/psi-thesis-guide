\section{Diagrams}

You can use diagrams to describe concepts and their relationship, the structure of systems, interactions, and (experimental) procedures.

\subsection{Before You Start}

Questions to ask when designing a diagram:\sidenote{Taken from the book ``Designing Science Presentations: A Visual Guide to Figures, Papers, Slides, Posters, and More'' \cite{Carter12}.}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is absolutely necessary to show?
\item What is not necessary to show?
\item What is most important and should be emphasized?
\item What is not important and should be secondary to the main message?
\item What are the relationships between individual elements?
\item Does the diagram require a precise depiction of time?
\item Does the diagram require a precise depiction of distance?
\item What symbols should be consistent throughout the diagram?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emphasizing Elements}

Good diagrams are self-explanatory and guide the reader's attention. Humans constantly search for patterns and deviations. Consistent use of shapes and colors indicates that the presented elements are similar (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:emphasis}). Deviation from the norm indicate differences that need attention. Be aware of that and do not create emphasis unintentionally.

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagram-emphasis}
\sidecaption{\label{fig:emphasis} Deviations from the norm create emphasis \cite{Carter12}.}[-4\baselineskip]
\end{figure}

Do not choose the size of elements arbitrarily. Differences translate into dominance relationships. Larger elements usually appear to control the smaller ones (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:dominance})

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagram-dominance}
\sidecaption{\label{fig:dominance} Relative differences in size indicate dominance relationships \cite{Carter12}.}[-4\baselineskip]
\end{figure}

In the absence of strong emphasis, readers process diagrams similar to text (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:direction}). In western cultures, readers will start in the top left corner and proceed horizontally in a zig-zag pattern. The general flow of information should be consistent with this expectation.

\end{marginfigure}

Many diagrams consist of shapes and lines, annotated with text labels. The labels should be as close as possible to the shapes (proximity) and exactly aligned. Whenever possible, consider moving the labels into the shapes (Fig.~\ref{labelsinside}). Inside labels reduce visual clutter and make it easier to create a well-balanced diagram that has no ragged edges.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagram-labelsinside}
\sidecaption{\label{fig:dominance} Moving the labels inside objects reduces clutter. Note how the left-hand-side figure is centered in the left part of the figure to keep the figure balanced \cite{Carter12}.}[-6\baselineskip]
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:labelsoutside} illustrates key principles when labels are outside of a shape. First of all, keep the lines as short as possible (proximity). Consider removing the arrowheads from the lines that point into an object to avoid confusion with other arrows in the diagram. Also, avoid crossing lines. Align labels on the left-hand side of an object flush right and vice versa. Aim for consistency by making the lines parallel. Keep adequate amounts of surrounding whitespace.
