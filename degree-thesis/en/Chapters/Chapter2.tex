An important property of a long document such as a thesis is consistency.%
\todo{This is a todo note. Use them to ensure consistency. When you print the final thesis, hide all todo notes by adding the parameter \emph{final} to the documentclass declaration.}
It is, however, quite difficult to keep track of terminology, style, and structure over an extended period of time.

Following certain conventions can help you to achieve a consistent result. This chapter summarizes conventions and recommendations for effective thesis writing.\marginnote{Having a signpost paragraph before the first section in a chapter is considered good style.}

This chapter contains only selected recommendations. For a more comprehensive list that also includes links to useful tools, consider \url{https://github.com/TheHairyJ/StudentResources/blob/master/Writing.md}.

\section{Links}

Special care is necessary when you include links in your thesis. URLs are generally embedded using the \verb|\url{}| command. This will allow LaTeX to break them at the end of a line. Moreover, they will become clickable.

It is a frequently asked question whether \emph{all} links should be embedded as proper references or not. We recommend to follow these principles:%
\marginnote{In the interest of ease of use, we neglect the principles in this guide.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Use a link} in the text (or as a footnote when it is a longer link) when the main purpose of providing the URL is to \emph{provide a reference to that particular location}. Example: links to the website of a service or product or to the homepage of a weblog, when the purpose is to make readers aware of its existence as a whole.
  \item \textbf{Use a reference} when the purpose is to \emph{refer to or discuss the content} on a website. References should generally mention the author and the publication date (at least the year). If the author cannot be identified, you can resort to using the name of the respective organization instead (use an additional pair of curly braces in BibTeX -- otherwise the name will be mis-interpreted as first name and last name). Example: linking to a particular blog post.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Link Rot}

\marginnote{See also: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot}{Link Rot in Wikipedia}}As the web is quite dynamic, many links do not work forever. Content may move to different URLs, it may be substantially altered, and sites may go out of service altogether. This phenomenon is called Link Rot, and it has become a significant issue in academia.

We generally recommend to \emph{archive all websites} whose URLs you provide using \textsc{The Wayback Machine} of the Internet Archive, which is available at \url{archive.org}.
This preserves the content of a website at the given point in time and makes it permanently available in the Internet Archive.

\marginnote{All links in this document have been archived at the time of its publication.}You should inform the reader about the availability of an archived version. We recommend to provide the \emph{original link} and add ``(archived at [date])'' after the URL. This applies to URLs in the main text, in footnotes, and in references.

Archiving is not necessary for academic papers that have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), have an ISBN/ISSN, or are available on \url{arxiv.org}.


\section{Citation and References}

Always try to cite the primary reference, i.\,e., the seminal paper that introduced a particular concept. You can cite well-known academic text books (instead of the original paper) when you cite fundamentals. No citation is necessary for popular knowledge: ``Authentication with passwords is popular.''

Most of the time, paraphrasing content is preferred over literally citing text with quotation marks. The most expressive way to integrate references to literature is to insert the labels right behind key terms or author names:
\begin{quote}
  EMV systems \cite{anderson_ross_emv:_2014} are used to secure payment cards. Murdoch et al. \cite{murdoch_steven_j._chip_2010} have shown that EMV systems are broken.
\end{quote}

Alternatively, you can append them to the end of a sentence or sentence fragment. In this case, the label must come \emph{before} the punctuation mark (such as a comma or period) if there is one, as shown in this sentence \cite{Hintz02}.

When you paraphrase longer pieces, it is considered poor style to add the label at the end of a paragraph that paraphrases content from the literature. Instead, you should make this explicit at the beginning of a paragraph, e.\,g. like this:
\begin{quote}
  The following paragraph describes the foo system \cite{kou_weidong_secure_2003}. …
\end{quote}

This approach is also suitable to indicate larger amounts of paraphrasing:
\begin{quote}
  Before we discuss the limitations of the foo system, we present its main functions in this section \cite{kou_weidong_secure_2003}. …
\end{quote}

When you cite from books or long papers, you can insert the page number like this: \verb|\cite[p. 5]{label}|, which results in \cite[p. 5]{kou_weidong_secure_2003}.

When you cite multiple references in one spot, you should include them in one \verb|\cite| command:
\begin{quote}
  The FOO approach appears in a wide variety of applications \cite{murdoch_steven_j._chip_2010,anderson_ross_emv:_2014,kou_weidong_secure_2003}.
\end{quote}

Note, however, that this style is not very useful for the reader.\footnote{This recommendation was originally given here: \url{https://nhigham.com/2014/12/22/more-tips-on-book-and-thesis-writing/}} Much more information can be given like this:
\begin{quote}
The FOO approach appears in a wide variety of applications, such as qux systems \cite{murdoch_steven_j._chip_2010}, baz systems \cite{anderson_ross_emv:_2014}, and -- much earlier -- in bar readers \cite{kou_weidong_secure_2003}.
\end{quote}

A remark on style: References should \emph{not} be treated as nouns. Avoid writing ``\cite{murdoch_steven_j._chip_2010} shows that many EMV systems are broken \ldots'' and replace it with ``Murdoch et al. show that EMV systems are broken  \cite{murdoch_steven_j._chip_2010}.''

\paragraph{BibTeX Snippets}

For many publications you will find BibTeX snippets online, for instance in the ACM Digital Library or on \url{https://dblp.org}. Using these snippets is generally recommended. Unfortunately, the quality of publicly available BibTeX snippets varies a lot. This means that you will have to edit them to create a consistent bibliography. For instance, make sure that the name of a particular conference is always spelled consistently in all entries. Moreover, you should remove superfluous information such as precise dates, multiple occurrences of the year, and the location of the conference.

A common issue is the capitalization of words in titles. Whether you use sentence case or title case is up to you -- as long as you stick to the choice. You may have to enclose the whole title of a bibitem in double curly braces to preserve capitalized letters. Alternatively, you can only enclose capitalized words or abbreviations in curly braces. Consider the following example in which we ensure that TCP is printed in uppercase:
\begin{verbatim}
   @inproceedings{... title = "Improving {TCP}-based Communication Systems" ...}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Margin Notes and Footnotes}

The template offers you the option to use margin notes and footnotes. You can use Margin notes (\verb|\marginnote|) as a replacement for footnotes. You can also use them with keywords or short phrases to attract the reader's attention.

Footnotes are either inserted directly after the particular word they refer to or after the punctuation if they relate to the whole clause or sentence.\footnote{Such as this footnote, here down at the bottom of the page: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.} Footnotes themselves should be full, descriptive sentences (beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop). The APA6 states: \enquote{Footnote numbers should be superscripted, [...], following any punctuation mark except a dash.} The Chicago manual of style states: \enquote{A note number should be placed at the end of a sentence or clause. The number follows any punctuation mark except the dash, which it precedes. It follows a closing parenthesis.}

Using both margin notes and footnotes for similar purposes may create an inconsistent appearance and is therefore discouraged.

\section{Tables}

Tables are an important way of displaying your results. \Cref{tab:treatments} is an example table which was generated with the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\begin{table}
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r r r}
\toprule
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tabhead{Results}} \\ \cmidrule(lr){2-3}
\tabhead{Group} & \tabhead{Treatment X} & \tabhead{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\ \addlinespace
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
5 & 0.61 & 0.9\\
6 & 0.18 & 0.1\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{table}
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r r r}
\toprule
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tabhead{Results}} \\ \cmidrule(lr){2-3}
\tabhead{Group} & \tabhead{Treatment X} & \tabhead{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\ \addlinespace
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
5 & 0.61 & 0.9\\
6 & 0.18 & 0.1\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Column heads should use sentence-style capitalization, i.\,e., do not use \emph{title case} as you would in section headings.

Tables have captions that always appear \emph{above} the \code{tabular} environment. All tables must be referred to in the main text.
You can reference tables with \verb|\ref{<label>}| where the label is defined within the table environment. See \file{Chapter1.tex} for an example of the label and citation (e.\,g., Table~\ref{tab:treatments}).

In the PSI Thesis template tables use the \emph{booktabs} style, which avoids visual clutter such all vertical lines. If you want to group columns, do it in the headers using \verb|\cmidrule|.

Horizontal lines should be used sparingly as well. You can add additional vertical space (using \verb|\addlinespace|) to group consecutive rows (as was done in Table~\ref{tab:treatments}). You can also use bold print to highlight especially relevant parts.

Note that Table~\ref{tab:treatments} is not laid out ideally: the numbers are given with different precision, which disturbs their alignment. Besides, strictly aligning  all numeric columns to the right is not always appropriate.
The effect of changing to centered alignment can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:treatments2}.

\begin{table}
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments2}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
\toprule
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tabhead{Results}} \\ \cmidrule(lr){2-3}
\tabhead{Group} & \tabhead{Treatment X} & \tabhead{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.20 & 0.80\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.70\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\ \addlinespace
4 & 0.68 & 0.30\\
5 & 0.61 & 0.90\\
6 & 0.18 & 0.10\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Figures}

There will hopefully be many figures in your thesis. Place them in the \emph{Figures} folder. 

Ideally, you draw all figures yourself to ensure that they have a consistent style (line thickness, arrow heads, shading). Make sure that your figures work when printed in monochrome, i.\,e., do not rely on colors. If you use colors, use the same color palette in all figures and ensure that the colors can be differentiated by readers with disabilities (color blindness).

Insert figures into your thesis using the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption[An Electron]{An electron (artist's impression).}
\label{fig:Electron}
\end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}

Also look in the source file. Putting the following code into the source file produces the picture of the electron that you can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:Electron}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption[An Electron]{An electron (artist's impression).}
\label{fig:Electron}
\end{figure}

The recommended figure placement is the top of the page (denoted by \code{[t]}). Don't worry about figures not appearing exactly where you write them in the source. The placement depends on how much space there is on the page for the figure. Sometimes there is not enough room to fit a figure directly where it should go (in relation to the text) and so LaTeX puts it at the top of the next page. Positioning figures is the job of LaTeX and so you should only worry about making them look good. Generally, everything is fine as long as a figure either appears on the page where it is referred to for the first time or on one of the subsequent pages.

Every figure needs a descriptive caption and a label. Figure captions must always appear below the included graphics file within the \code{figure} environment.

Every figure must be referenced in the text at least once, either in parentheses (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:Electron}) or explicitly in the sentence: Figure~\ref{fig:Electron} shows an electron. Refer to figures using the abbreviation \code{Fig.} followed by a protected space (\verb|~|) and \verb|\ref|. Exception: write \code{Figure} if it is the first word of a sentence. Note \verb|Fig.| and \verb|Figure| are capitalized when they are used as part of a reference.

The \verb|\caption| command contains two parts,%
\marginnote{Theses at PSI usually do not have a List of Figures. You can, therefore, omit the part in square brackets.} 
the first part, inside the square brackets is the title that will appear in the \emph{List of Figures}, and so should be short.
 The second part in the curly brackets should contain the longer and more descriptive caption text.

The \verb|\decoRule| command is optional and simply puts a horizontal line below the image. This can be useful with figures that are not symmetrical or whose exterior is not evenly defined at the bottom.

Resize your figures, ideally consistently, to an appropriate size, e.\,g., a fraction of \texttt{\textbackslash textwidth}.

LaTeX is capable of using images in PDF, JPG, and PNG format. Using vectorized figures (PDF) is preferred as they usually provide sharper results at a smaller file size. If you \emph{have} to use pixel graphics, create them with a sufficiently high resolution, i.\,e, at least 300 dpi.

\paragraph{Side-by-Side Figures} Sometimes it is desirable to show multiple figures side-by-side. There are several approaches, for instance, by using the \texttt{subfigure} package. In many cases, a comprehensive subfigure support is not really needed. A lightweight approach as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sidebyside} may be sufficient. This result is achieved with the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}%
\hspace{\fill}%
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption{A blue electron (left) and another one (right).}
\label{fig:sidebyside}
\end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}%
\hspace{\fill}%
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption{A blue electron (left) and another one (right).}
\label{fig:sidebyside}
\end{figure}


\section{Listings}

Code listings are done with the \emph{listings} package.\marginnote{If you have Python, you can consider the more modern package \code{minted}, which uses {pygments} for syntax highlighting.} You can use the environment \code{lstfloat} to create floating listings. Floating listings behave very much like floating figures and tables, i.\,e., they have a caption and can be referenced. Moreover, floating listings are guaranteed to appear on a single page. An example can be found in Listing~\ref{lst:listing}.

The properties of floating listings may not always be desired. For short code fragments, it often makes more sense to use a non-floating listing.

\begin{lstfloat}
\caption{\label{lst:listing} This is an example of syntax highlighting of Python code with a relatively long caption.}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import numpy as np
 
def incmatrix(genl1,genl2):
    m = len(genl1)
    n = len(genl2)
    M = None #to become the incidence matrix
    VT = np.zeros((n*m,1), int)  #dummy variable
 
    #compute the bitwise xor matrix
    M1 = bitxormatrix(genl1)
    M2 = np.triu(bitxormatrix(genl2),1) 
 
    for i in range(m-1):
        for j in range(i+1, m):
            [r,c] = np.where(M2 == M1[i,j])
            for k in range(len(r)):
                VT[(i)*n + r[k]] = 1;
                VT[(i)*n + c[k]] = 1;
                VT[(j)*n + r[k]] = 1;
                VT[(j)*n + c[k]] = 1;
 
                if M is None:
                    M = np.copy(VT)
                else:
                    M = np.concatenate((M, VT), 1)
 
                VT = np.zeros((n*m,1), int)
 
    return M
\end{lstlisting}
\end{lstfloat}


\section{Mathematics}

The \enquote{Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX} (available on \href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}{CTAN}) should tell you everything you need to know for most cases of typesetting mathematics. If you need more information, a much more thorough mathematical guide is available from the AMS called, \enquote{A Short Math Guide to \LaTeX} and can be downloaded from
\url{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf}.

There are many different LaTeX symbols to remember, luckily you can find the most common symbols in \href{http://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive}{The Comprehensive \LaTeX~Symbol List}.

You can write an equation, which is automatically given an equation number by LaTeX like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\begin{equation}
E = mc^{2}
\label{eqn:Einstein}
\end{equation}
\end{lstlisting}

This will produce Einstein's famous energy-matter equivalence equation:
\begin{equation}
E = mc^{2}
\label{eqn:Einstein}
\end{equation}

All equations you write are automatically given equation numbers by LaTeX. If you don't want a particular equation numbered, use the unnumbered form:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\[ a^{2}=4 \]
\end{lstlisting}

You can also have equations in the middle of a paragraph: \( E = mc^{2} \). This can be achieved with this code: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\( E = mc^{2} \)
\end{lstlisting}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Structure}

You should break your thesis up into chapters and sections. LaTeX automatically builds a Table of Contents by looking at all the \verb|\chapter{}|, \verb|\section{}|  and \verb|\subsection{}| commands you write in the source. You may even think about using \emph{sub}subsections (\verb|\subsubsection{}|). All of these will be hierarchically numbered.

Avoid dangling elements in the hierarchy. This means that if you have a Section~1.1, you should also have (at least) Section~1.2. This is true for all levels of the hierarchy.

Note, however, that (sub-)subsections should only be used if you use them consistently in all or multiple chapters. Otherwise, you should opt for a \verb|paragraph{}|, which structures pieces of content with unobtrusive non-numbered inline headings.

The Table of Contents should only list \emph{chapters} and \emph{sections}. Listing \emph{(sub-)subsections} is not recommended as this results in a very long Table of Contents, which may become difficult to read. The depth to which the Table of Contents is formatted is set within \file{setup.tex}. If you need this changed, search for \texttt{\textbackslash etocsettocdepth}.

Use \emph{title case} in your \emph{chapters}, \emph{sections}, and \emph{paragraphs}. Consider, for instance, \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com} for title case capitalization rules.

Within a section, you should walk the reader through your text:
\begin{quote}
In the following, we describe the three primitives of concept X. First, X uses the Y algorithm. …

The second concept is Z …
\end{quote}

\section{Typography}

Use emphasis sparingly. This is especially true for \textbf{bold print} (\verb|\textbf{bold print}|). Resist the desire to use it in the main text. Use \emph{italics} (\verb|\textbf{italics}|) instead.

\marginnote{See also \href{https://sblhs2.com/2016/09/15/italics-scare-quotes/}{Italics or Scare Quotes?}} Note, however, that too frequent use of italics can also be annoying. We recommend to limit its use to emphasize the case when an ordinary word will be used as a special term and only at its first occurrence. It can also be used to mark words that you would intonate differently in speech to indicate that they have a special meaning in a sentence.

\marginnote{See \href{https://style.mla.org/quotes-when-nothing-is-being-quoted/}{Quotes When Nothing Is Being Quoted}}Generally, we recommend to avoid using scare quotes. They convey an informal tone and may confuse the reader as the intended meaning is ambiguous.

You should split your content into paragraphs. This is done in LaTeX by having an empty line between adjacent blocks of text in the source file. Using a mixture of paragraphs and line breaks, which are achieved with \verb|\\| at the end of a line is discouraged because it creates a noisy layout.

Use thin spaces (\verb|\,|) in the appropriate places. For instance, write \verb|i.\,e.,| to obtain i.\,e., which is spoken ``that is''. The same applies to e.\,g. Both abbreviations are followed by a comma in American English.

Dashes can be used instead of colons or pairs of commas to mark off a nested clause. Use an \emph{en dash} for that purpose -- like in this example. If you cannot type an \emph{en dash} on your keyboard, you can write two regular hyphens next to each other. LaTeX will substitute them with an \emph{en dash}. While we have no strict preference, we recommend to use \emph{en dashes} instead of the longer \emph{em dashes}.

Use en dashes also within ranges, e.\,g., when you write something like 5--10\,\% (note the thin space before the \% symbol).

Use a proper \emph{minus symbol} (e.\,g., by using math mode like this \(-1.337\)). Also, use a sensible number of digits after the decimal point.

Use proper typographic quotation marks like ``these'' (which can be obtained with \verb|``these''| -- or by copy-and-pasting the respective Unicode characters).

If you speak German, consider reading \textsc{typokurz} (\url{https://zvisionwelt.wordpress.com/downloads/}), a short introduction into typographic issues. More detailed information can be found on Matthew Butterick's website \url{https://practicaltypography.com}.

\section{Language}

Ensure correct spelling throughout your text. Check your writing with a spell checker. There are special spellcheckers for LaTeX, but copy-and-pasting the text into Word may also be an option.

Ensure proper hyphenation throughout your text. This becomes necessary, for instance, when a word extends into the margin of the page (creating a so-called \emph{overfull hbox}). You can override LaTeX's hyphenation rules by inserting \verb|\-| into a word. This special character indicates a conditional hyphenation point.

Often, it makes sense to define hyphenation rules globally. This can be achieved by adding hyphenation instructions after \verb|\begin{document}: |\verb|\hyphenation{FORTRAN Hy-phen-a-tion}| will prevent hyphenation in the word FORTRAN and define hyphenation points in the word Hyphenation.

Also, check your text for common grammar issues (cf. Sect.~\ref{sec:style}).

\section{Style}
\label{sec:style}

This section contains only selected pieces of advice on particular aspects and typical errors. For a more comprehensive treatment, we refer the reader to the paragraph \nameref{par:commonbugs} at the end of this section.

The main goal of a thesis is to convey information without unambiguity. Write concise and use easy language. Avoid complex sentence structures and unnecessary complex words. A thesis is not the place to show off your mastery of grammar and vocabulary. There are various (mostly web-based and commercial) tools that can help you identify common issues in your text.\footnote{We are aware of \url{https://grammarly.com}, \url{https://languagetool.org}, \url{http://www.hemingwayapp.com} as well as the command-line tool Academic-Writing-Check (\url{https://github.com/devd/Academic-Writing-Check}).}

Even if a text uses easy language, it may be difficult to read, because it does not convey the writer's train of thoughts coherently. In short, the goal is that every sentence should be explicitly connected to its predecessor. This is, of course, easier said than done.

\subsection{The Science of Scientific Writing}

A good resource to develop this skill is the article \emph{The Science of Scientific Writing} by George d. Gopen and Judith A. Swan.\footnote{The article can be obtained from \url{https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~swanson/papers/science-of-writing.pdf} and \url{https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing}} 

The advice from this article is also part of the three lessons on scientific writing offered by Duke University.\footnote{Homepage of the lessons: \url{https://cgi.duke.edu/web/sciwriting/}, PDF slides: \url{https://cgi.duke.edu/web/sciwriting/resources/201108_DukeScientificWritingWorkshop.pdf} (these URLs could not be archived).}

The remainder of this section contains three excerpts from \emph{The Science of Scientific Writing}. See the original source for a more extended treatment including worked examples.

\paragraph{Subject-Verb Separation (Excerpt)}

  Readers expect a grammatical subject to be followed immediately by the verb. Anything of length that intervenes between subject and verb is read as an interruption, and therefore as something of lesser importance.
The reader’s expectation stems from a pressing need for syntactic resolution, fulfilled only by the arrival of the verb. Without the verb, we do not know what the subject is doing, or what the sentence is all about.

As a result, the reader focuses attention on the arrival of the verb and resists recognizing anything in the interrupting material as being of primary importance.
The longer the interruption lasts, the more likely it becomes that the “interruptive” material actually contains important information; but its structural location will continue to brand it as merely interruptive.
Unfortunately, the reader will not discover its true value until too late – until the sentence has ended without having produced anything of much value outside of the subject-verb interruption.

\paragraph{The Stress Position}

It is a linguistic commonplace that readers naturally emphasize the material that arrives at the end of a sentence. We refer to that location as a “stress position.”
Beginning with the exciting material and ending with a lack of luster often leaves us disappointed and destroys our sense of momentum.

The stress position can change in size from sentence to sentence. Sometimes it consists of a single word; sometimes it extends to several lines. The definitive factor is this: The stress position coincides with the moment of syntactic closure. A reader has reached the beginning of the stress position when she knows there is nothing left in the clause or sentence but the material presently being read.

To summarize the principles connected with the stress position, we have the proverbial wisdom, “Save the best for last.”

\paragraph{The Topic Position}

To summarize the principles connected with the other end of the sentence, which we will call the topic position, we have its proverbial contradiction, “First things first.”
In the stress position the reader needs and expects closure and fulfillment; in the topic position the reader needs and expects perspective and context.

The information that begins a sentence establishes for the reader a perspective for viewing the sentence as a unit: Readers expect a unit of discourse to be a story about whoever shows up first. “Bees disperse pollen” and “Pollen is dispersed by bees” are two different but equally respectable sentences about the same facts. The first tells us something about bees; the second tells us something about pollen. In fact, “Pollen is dispersed by bees” is the superior sentence if it appears in a paragraph that intends to tell us a continuing story about pollen. Pollen’s story at that moment is a passive one.

Readers also expect the material occupying the topic position to provide them with linkage (looking backward) and context (looking forward).

\subsection{Selected Syntactical Conventions}

Avoid using contractions such as \emph{can't}, \emph{don't}, and \emph{it's}. Replace them with \emph{cannot}, \emph{do not}, and \emph{it is}.

We highly recommend to use the \textbf{serial comma} in all lists to avoid ambiguity. The serial comma is also known as the \emph{Oxford comma}. It is inserted before the word \emph{and} that leads the last item of a list. Consider this example:\footnote{Source: \url{https://nhigham.com/2016/02/16/the-serial-or-oxford-comma/}}
\begin{quote}
  Three important techniques in the design of algorithms are bisection, divide and conquer, and recursion.
\end{quote}

Use \textbf{bullet lists} correctly. ``Lists are common in all forms of writing. The list items can be included within the text or put on separate lines. Separate lines are used in order to draw attention to the items, to ease reading when the items are long or numerous, or to facilitate cross-reference to specific items.''\footnote{Source: \url{https://nhigham.com/2015/12/17/punctuating-lists/}} The environments \code{itemize} and \code{enumerate} produce lists on separate lines. It is considered good style to use punctuation in such a way that the lists form full sentences if their items were not split onto separate lines. This convention is fulfilled when every list item is a full sentence. If list items are sentence fragments, however, additional punctuation is necessary (example taken from the source mentioned in the footnote):

\begin{quote}
  We used three different algorithms in the experiments. The table reports the performance of
\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithm 3.1 (based on a Taylor series),
\item Algorithm 3.2 (with parameter \(k = 1\)), and
\item Algorithm 3.3 (with tolerance \(10^{-8}\)).
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Common Bugs in Writing}
\label{par:commonbugs}
Read the comprehensive list of common bugs in writing by Henning Schulzrinne, which is available at \url{http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-bugs.html}.

\section{Concluding Remarks}

Scientific work and writing are skills that can be practiced. Seminar papers serve that purpose during the studies. The final thesis should then show which methodical and technical skills have been acquired. In addition to good time management, discipline, and willingness to research literature, communication with one's supervisor is a key to success.

\paragraph{Further Reading}

This guide is not meant to cover all topics of scientific writing in detail. We recommend to consider the very comprehensive document \emph{Scientific Writing for Computer Science Students} by Wilhelmiina Hämäläinen (\url{http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/pages/whamalai/sciwri/sciwri.pdf}). Hämäläinen has collected a substantial amount of advice with a particular focus on English grammar and the peculiarities of computer science.

There is also an abundant number of books on scientific writing. We can recommend the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item M. Alley. The Craft of Scientific Writing; and
\item W. Strunk and E.B. White. The Elements of Style.
\end{itemize}

Finally, if you seek inspiration, we recommend to read these reports by well-known scientists:
\begin{itemize}
\item Randy Pausch: Time Management (\url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0}),
\item Richard Hamming: You and Your Research (\url{http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html}), and
\item Nick Feamster: Writing Tips for Academics (\url{http://greatresearch.org/2013/10/11/storytelling-101-writing-tips-for-academics/}).
\end{itemize}

The remaining parts of this guide contain less often needed technical details and historical information about the template as well as a loose collection of assorted advice.
