# PSITheses: A LuaLaTeX Template and Thesis Writing Guide

This repository contains a LaTeX template and a guide for writing a thesis.
For now, there is only an English version of this template.

Read Chapters 1 and 2 in the Guide for instructions on using the
template. The Guide contains a lot of concrete recommendations that may
help you write a compelling scientific thesis. A particular focus is
on the topic of designing useful figures and tables.

The template has been created mainly for students who want to submit a
high-quality thesis to the Chair of Privacy and Security in Information
Systems (PSI) at University of Bamberg (https://www.uni-bamberg.de/psi/).
The template can also be used for seminar reports and PhD dissertations.

The PSIThesis template and the guide reflect, at least to some degree, the
personal taste of members of the chair. We encourage our students to use
the template without any changes. If you \emph{do} have a different opinion
on a particular aspect of the template or the guide, we will be happy to hear
you out.

The template and the guide are available under an open license (CC BY SA 4.0). 
If you want to use the template for a thesis submitted at a different 
department or organization, feel free to make changes at your discretion.
Redistribution of the guide and the template is subject to the license (see
details explained in LICENSE.md and the Guide).

If you wish to contribute to the template or the guide, you may create an Issue or a Pull Request in the GitHub repository.

The PSIThesis template consists of a document class (PSIThesis.cls) and
additional TeX files. The template is based on the MastersDoctoralThesis
template, which has been downloaded from
https://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis.

The thesis guide (guide.pdf) is typeset with the the PSIThesis template.
The guide demonstrates the features of the template. The source files of
the guide are contained in this repository. You can refer to the source
files to see how the template is used in a real-world document.

Note that some of the figures in guide.pdf have been reproduced from the
literature with permission of the publishers and the authors. As we do not
have permission to redistribute these figures, they are not contained in
this repository.
