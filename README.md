# PSITheses: A LuaLaTeX Template and Thesis Writing Guide

This repository contains a LaTeX template and a guide for writing a thesis.
For now, there is only an English version of this template.

Read Chapters 1 and 2 in the file guide.pdf for instructions on using this
template.

This template has been created mainly for students who want to submit a
high-quality thesis to the Chair of Privacy and Security in Information
Systems (PSI) at University of Bamberg (https://www.uni-bamberg.de/psi/).
The design of the template and the recommendations in this guide reflect,
at least to some degree, the personal taste of members of the chair. If
you submit a thesis to PSI, you can use the template without any changes.

The template and the guide are, however, available under an open license
(cf. Chapter 1 in guide.pdf and LICENSE.md). If you want to use the
template for a thesis submitted at a different department or organization, feel free to make changes at your discretion.

The PSIThesis template consists of a document class (PSIThesis.cls) and
additional TeX files. The template is based on the MastersDoctoralThesis
template, which has been downloaded from
https://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis.

The thesis guide (guide.pdf) is typeset with the the PSIThesis template.
The guide demonstrates the features of the template. The source files of
the guide are contained in this repository. You can refer to the source
files to see how the template is used in a real-world document.

Note that some of the figures in guide.pdf have been reproduced from the
literature with permission of the publishers and the authors. As we do not
have permission to redistribute these figures, they are not contained in
this repository.
